            <p>I found any number of ideas on what these values could be but ultimately they all were built around the assumption of particular devices (often Apple products) that the numbers were based upon. I wanted something hardware agnostic, and the only good reference I found in this regard was Microsoft's Windows 10 app guidelines. I found them compelling as there really is not another OS that can claim to have thought through the one app for every device thing, and they do not reference specific hardware.</p>

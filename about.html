            <p>Where to start...</p>
            <p>I grew up in Calgary where I never got along with school, but learned to love the mountains and all the activites to be found there.</p>
            <p>In my early teens my father introduced me to climbing mountains and ever since standing on top of peaks is something I am willing to suffer to an unreasonable degree to experience. Now as my 30's are disappearing I have climbed more peaks than I can recount and have yet to find a reason to stop.</p>

            <p>My other long-time love is skiing in all it's forms. I am an expert downhill, reasonably strong cross-country, love exploring on touring skis in the backcountry, and spent many years working as a Ski Patroler at resorts near Vancouver</p>
            <img src="img/P3290215_2.jpg" alt="ski touring">
            <p>When my girlfriend (now wife) decided to work on a doctoral degree at UBC I sure couldn't let her go alone so I moved to Vancouver with her. That was 12 years ago, and while we've had our issues with the housing market (who doesn't?) here and for a couple years in Squamish, we now live in New Westminster.</p>
            <p>While in Calgary I completed a bachelors degree in Applied Policy Studies at Mount Royal College (now University) and then quickley decided I didn't care to sit at a desk and took up carpentry with a long time aquaintence. After moving to the Lower Mainland I began a variety of service jobs ranging from selling gear at MEC to guiding trips in the backcountry of BC.</p>
            <p>Computers have long been a hobby of mine, and while my experience doesn't stretch to the dark ages, it does include the medieval ages with such memories as: 14.4k modems and that horrific noise, image-less web browsing, getting a coffee while waiting for pages to load, and a time before Goolge. I have long been handy with computer hardware, and a proponent of free and open source software, but my experience with software was almost always as user. I have long dabbled in programing, but that was mostly limited to copy+paste coding in simple applications.</p>
            <p>Other hobbies of mine include:</p>
            <p>Video Games -- I am somewhat of a coniseur but some of my favorites are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy" target="_blank">Katamary Damacy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls" target="_blank">Dark Souls</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus" target="_blank">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni_no_Kuni" target="_blank">Ni No Kumi</a>.</p>
            <p>RC vehicles -- which these days is mostly small (less than 250g) helicopters.</p>
            <p>and running wild with fan theories to fill in the continuity holes of toddler television programs -- ask me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAW_Patrol" target="_blank">Paw Patrol</a> if you want to waste half an hour.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I have recently been driving a school bus as a way to stay closer to home and deal with childcare, which has left me some spare time to consider where I want to move with my career. As an avid video game player I have dreams of getting involved in their creation, but my truest dream would be the creation of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age" target="_blank">"Illustrated Primer for Girls"</a> to revolutionize education. There are of course many products that aim to educate, but none have met my aspirations as of yet; in fact most have been underwhelming examples of poor software designed to cost lots of money for government entities to buy.</p>
            <p>Since a dream like that doesn't create itself I decided really learning to program would be a good first step.</p>
            <p>I recognize that at this point in my life I am unlikely to become an all-star programer, but with my interpersonal and leaderships skills, I think my path forward will be in managing projects, but only time will tell.</p>

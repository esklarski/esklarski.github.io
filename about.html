            <p>Where to start...</p>
            <p>I grew up in Calgary where I was happiest outdoors. I learned to love the mountains and all the activities I found there.</p>
            <p>In my early teens my father introduced me to climbing mountains and since then standing on top of peaks is something I am willing to suffer for to experience. Now in my late 30's I have climbed more peaks than I can recount and have no reason to stop.</p>

            <p>My other long-time love is skiing in all it's forms. I am an expert downhill, reasonably strong cross-country, love exploring on touring skis in the backcountry, and have spent many years working as a Ski Patroller at resorts near Vancouver</p>

            <p>When my partner decided to work on a degree at UBC I certainly couldn't let them go alone so I moved to Vancouver too. That was 12 years ago, and while we have had our issues with the housing market (who doesn't?) living in the lower mainland and for a couple years in Squamish, we now live in New Westminster.</p>
            <p>While in Calgary I completed a bachelor's degree in Applied Policy Studies at Mount Royal University and then quickly decided I didn't want a career that kept me sitting at a desk. I took up carpentry with a long time master craftsman and learned skills that will last me a lifetime. After moving to the Lower Mainland I began a variety of service jobs ranging from selling gear at MEC to guiding trips in the backcountry of BC.</p>

            <p>Computers have long been a hobby of mine, and while my experience doesn't stretch to the dark ages, it does include the middle ages with such memories as: 14.4k modems and that horrific noise, image-less web browsing, getting a coffee while waiting for pages to load, and a time before Google. I have always been handy with computer hardware, and a proponent of free and open source software, but my experience was almost always as user. I have long dabbled in programming, mostly limited to copy+paste coding to modify applications for my own needs.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Some hobbies of mine include:</p>
            <p>Video Games -- I am a connoisseur who enjoys most categories of games; some of my top picks would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy" target="_blank">Katamary Damacy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls" target="_blank">Dark Souls</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus" target="_blank">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni_no_Kuni" target="_blank">Ni No Kumi</a>.</p>
            <p>Photography -- as with computers my photography experience is quite extensive. I learned shooting black and white film on a camera my Grandpa handed down to me, sharpened my skills shooting slide film, and have adapted my skills to the modern world brought about by digital cameras and software darkroom.</p>
            <p>RC vehicles -- which these days is mostly small (less than 250g) helicopters. I spend as much time tinkering and repairing as flying.</p>
            <p>Running wild with fan theories -- toddler television leaves a lot of continuity holes and I enjoy speculating about these missing pieces. Ask me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAW_Patrol" target="_blank">Paw Patrol</a> if you want to waste half an hour.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I have recently been driving a school bus as a way to stay closer to home and help with childcare, which has left me some spare time to consider where I want to move with my career. As an avid video game player I have dreams of getting involved in their creation, but my grandest dream would be the creation of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age" target="_blank">"Illustrated Primer for Girls"</a> to revolutionize education (and not just for girls). There are many products on the market that aim to educate, but none have met my aspirations; in fact most have been underwhelming examples of poor software designed to cost considerable money for government entities to buy.</p>
            <p>Since a dream like that doesn't create itself I decided really learning to program would be a good first step.</p>

            <!-- so what does this have to do with work at all? -->
            <!-- <p>I recognize that at this point in my life I am unlikely to become an all-star programer, but with my interpersonal and leaderships skills, I think my path forward will be in managing projects, but only time will tell.</p> -->
